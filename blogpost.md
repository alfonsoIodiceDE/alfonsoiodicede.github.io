#### Categorical distances: the delta framework

Feb 2024

Use of different distances/dissimilarities for categorical data on different datasets: experiments on supervised (KNN) and unsupervised (partitioning around medoids) distance-based methods. Repeated cross-validation assessment of the performace.
