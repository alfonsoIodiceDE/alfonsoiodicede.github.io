### Statistical Learning slides

These slides illustrate instroductory linear regression, mostly based on the book: 
[An introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com):  the slides contain examples from the book, reproduced via tidymodels. Content-related comments and advices are more than welcome.

### Extra's 

[On the bias/variance trade-off](teaching_related/the_bias_and_the_variance.html)

Using synthetic data to explicitely compute the bias, the variance, the expected test MSE. 

[On the output of the MASS::lda()](teaching_related/Lda_MASS_wrap_up.html)

The output of the function for linear discriminant is based on Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, and this differs from the 
computations described in the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning.
